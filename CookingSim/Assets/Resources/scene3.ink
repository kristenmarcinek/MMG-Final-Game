You hear an alarm buzzing near your ear. You wake up...

As your eyes slowly open, you think about your day. It's Friday! You know your kids have had a busy school week, maybe you can make a special breakfast to send them off into the last day before their weekend?

*[Scroll through Facebook] You take a brief look at Facebook. As you scroll through post after post mindlessly, you come across a cooking video. You pause to see what they're making, and you see some delicious, cheesey omelettes. Your stomach rumbles at the sight. Maybe that would make a good breakfast for the kids! -> END
